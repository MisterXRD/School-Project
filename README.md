# **School Project**

On this project, I will be creating an executable which will able to compute and calculate the exact amount of a given planet’s surface gravity only using its known mass and radius. The regular edition of this project will be created using C/C++ in the Visual Studio 2022.

This project will also have a ready-to-use browser-supported edition written in JavaScript. I was going to write object-oriented code for the browser edition, but as the script has only one function, we wouldn't really need to get into OOP stuff at all.

Every single code in this project is/will be written by me, the author and the only developer of the project. 

Just to come clean about my identity, this is KÜTÜKER, E. (10-D/548) 

I usually prefer to use and go by my other name NORMAN, J. Charles on the internet though. One of my most populer aliases is Mr. Radix – as Radix DLT is my favourite DeFi protocol.
